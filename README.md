# Sewage Pipes Blockage Detection
Camera based software to autonomosusly detect blockages and defects in sewer pipes. This is a machine learning problem, but I thought it would be interesting to see if it can be solved using OpenCV and simple math. The software manages to detect 90% of blockages in sewage path.
 
 ## Prerequisites
 1 - Python 3
 2 - Sewer pipe insepction video such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlqL6R-W_E4
